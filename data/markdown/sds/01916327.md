Hazardous decomposition 
products 
:  Carbon oxides.   
 
SECTION 6: Accidental release measures 
 
Personal precautions :  Use personal protective equipment.  Ensure adequate 
ventilation.   
 
Environmental precautions :  Prevent further leakage or spillage if safe to do so.   
 
Methods for cleaning up :  Contain spillage, and then collect with non-combustible 
absorbent material, (e.g. sand, earth, diatomaceous earth, 
vermiculite) and place in container for disposal according to 
local / national regulations (see section 13).  Keep in suitable, 
closed containers for disposal.   
 
SECTION 7: Handling and storage 
Handling 
 
Advice on safe handling :  Avoid formation of aerosol.  For personal protection see 
section 8.  Smoking, eating and drinking should be prohibited 
in the application area.  Provide sufficient air exchange and/or 
exhaust in work rooms.  Dispose of rinse water in accordance 
with local and national regulations.   
 
Advice on protection 
against fire and explosion 
:  Do not spray on a naked flame or any incandescent material.  
Keep away from open flames, hot surfaces and sources of 
ignition.   
 
 
Storage 
 
Requirements for storage 
areas and containers 
:  No smoking.  Keep in a well-ventilated place.  Observe label 
precautions.  Electrical installations / working materials must 
comply with the technological safety standards.   
 
Use : Drilling Fluid Additive 
 
SECTION 8: Exposure controls/personal protection 
 
Engineering measures 
Adequate ventilation to control airborned concentrations below the exposure guidelines/limits.  
Consider the potential hazards of this material (see Section 2), applicable exposure limits, job 
activities, and other substances in the work place when designing engineering controls and selecting 
personal protective equipment.  If engineering controls or work practices are not adequate to prevent 
exposure to harmful levels of this material, the personal protective equipment listed below is 
recommended.  The user should read and understand all instructions and limitations supplied with 
the equipment since protection is usually provided for a limited time or under certain circumstances. 
 
Personal protective equipment 
 
Respiratory protection :  If ventilation or other engineering controls are not adequate to 
maintain minimal oxygen content of 19.5% by volume under

normal atmospheric pressure, a supplied-air NIOSH approved 
respirator may be appropriate.  If exposure to harmful levels of 
airborne material may occur, a NIOSH approved respirator that 
provides protection may be appropriate, such as:.  Air-Purifying 
Respirator for Organic Vapors.  A positive pressure, air-
supplying respirator may be appropriate if there is potential for 
uncontrolled release, aerosolization, exposure levels are not 
known, or other circumstances where air-purifying respirators 
may not provide adequate protection. 
   
 
Hand protection :  The suitability for a specific workplace should be discussed 
with the producers of the protective gloves.  Please observe 
the instructions regarding permeability and breakthrough time 
which are provided by the supplier of the gloves. Also take into 
consideration the specific local conditions under which the 
product is used, such as the danger of cuts, abrasion, and the 
contact time.  Gloves should be discarded and replaced if there 
is any indication of degradation or chemical breakthrough.   
 
Eye protection :  Eye wash bottle with pure water.  Tightly fitting safety goggles.   
 
Skin and body protection :  Choose body protection in relation to its type, to the 
concentration and amount of dangerous substances, and to the 
specific work-place.  Wear as appropriate:.  Flame retardant 
protective clothing.  Footwear protecting against chemicals.   
 
Hygiene measures :  Wash hands before breaks and at the end of workday.

ponds, waterways or ditches with chemical or used container.  
Send to a licensed waste management company.   
 
Contaminated packaging :  Empty remaining contents.  Dispose of as unused product.  
Do not re-use empty containers.  Do not burn, or use a cutting 
torch on, the empty drum.   
 
SECTION 14: Transport information 
The shipping descriptions shown here are for bulk shipments only, and may not apply to 
shipments in non-bulk packages (see regulatory definition).
