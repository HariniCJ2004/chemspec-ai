fighting 
:  Do not allow run-off from fire fighting to enter drains or water 
courses.   
 
Special protective 
equipment for fire-fighters 
:  Wear self-contained breathing apparatus for firefighting if 
necessary.   
 
Further information :  Collect contaminated fire extinguishing water separately. This 
must not be discharged into drains.  Fire residues and 
contaminated fire extinguishing water must be disposed of in 
accordance with local regulations.

SECTION 7: Handling and storage 
Handling 
 
Advice on safe handling :  Do not breathe vapors/dust.  Avoid exposure - obtain special 
instructions before use.  Avoid contact with skin and eyes.  For 
personal protection see section 8.  Smoking, eating and 
drinking should be prohibited in the application area.  Dispose 
of rinse water in accordance with local and national 
regulations.  Persons susceptible to skin sensitization problems 
or asthma, allergies, chronic or recurrent respiratory disease 
should not be employed in any process in which this mixture is 
being used.   
 
Advice on protection 
against fire and explosion 
:  Normal measures for preventive fire protection.   
 
 
Storage 
 
Requirements for storage 
areas and containers 
:  Keep container tightly closed in a dry and well-ventilated place.  
Containers which are opened must be carefully resealed and 
kept upright to prevent leakage.  Observe label precautions.

Engineering measures 
Adequate ventilation to control airborned concentrations below the exposure guidelines/limits.  
Consider the potential hazards of this material (see Section 2), applicable exposure limits, job 
activities, and other substances in the work place when designing engineering controls and selecting 
personal protective equipment.  If engineering controls or work practices are not adequate to prevent 
exposure to harmful levels of this material, the personal protective equipment listed below is 
recommended.  The user should read and understand all instructions and limitations supplied with 
the equipment since protection is usually provided for a limited time or under certain circumstances.  
 
Personal protective equipment 
 
Respiratory protection :  Wear a supplied-air NIOSH approved respirator unless 
ventilation or other engineering controls are adequate to 
maintain minimal oxygen content of 19.5% by volume under 
normal atmospheric pressure.  Wear a NIOSH approved 
respirator that provides protection when working with this 
material if exposure to harmful levels of airborne material may 
occur, such as:.  Use a positive pressure, air-supplying 
respirator if there is potential for uncontrolled release, 
aerosolization, exposure levels are not known, or other

circumstances where air-purifying respirators may not provide 
adequate protection. 
   
 
Hand protection :  The suitability for a specific workplace should be discussed 
with the producers of the protective gloves.  Please observe 
the instructions regarding permeability and breakthrough time 
which are provided by the supplier of the gloves. Also take into 
consideration the specific local conditions under which the 
product is used, such as the danger of cuts, abrasion, and the 
contact time.  Gloves should be discarded and replaced if there 
is any indication of degradation or chemical breakthrough.   
 
Eye protection :  Eye wash bottle with pure water.  Tightly fitting safety goggles.   
 
Skin and body protection :  Choose body protection in relation to its type, to the 
concentration and amount of dangerous substances, and to the 
specific work-place.  Wear as appropriate:.  Remove and wash 
contaminated clothing before re-use.  Skin should be washed 
after contact.  Footwear protecting against chemicals.   
 
Hygiene measures :  When using do not eat or drink.  When using do not smoke.  
Wash hands before breaks and at the end of workday.   
 
Protective measures :  Wear suitable protective equipment.  When using do not eat, 
drink or smoke.  Avoid contact with skin.
