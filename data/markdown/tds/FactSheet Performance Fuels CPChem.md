Safety and Handling  
Gasoline and diesel fuels are extremely volatile and flammable liquids. These products have the potential to cause fires if e xposed to an 
ignitable source.  Electrostatic charge can  accumulate and create a hazardous condition when handling these materials.  Due to their 
inherent characteristics, there are specific requirements for handling, storage, transportation, labeling and disposal. Gasol ine and diesel 
fuels are also described a s being hazardous to human health and the environment.  Therefore use only in well vented areas, wear proper 
protective equipment, and care should be taken to avoid releases to sewage and drainage systems and water bodies. 
 
Gasoline and diesel fuels are compatible and should be stored in carbon or stainless steel, aluminum, fluorinated polyethylene, fluorinated 
polypropylene, and most fiberglasses. Gaskets should be Teflon ® or Viton® fluoroelastomer; diesels are not compatible with nitrile 
elastomers, EPDM, butyl, or silicone materials. Both fuels should be kept away from oxygen and strong oxidizing agents. 
 
Gasoline and diesel  fuels are not appreciabl y soluble in water. Neither fuel should be allowed to enter drains, water courses or the soil. 
Spillage coll ected with non -combustible absorbent material such as sand should be placed in containers using spark resistant tools for 
disposal according to local/national regulations.
