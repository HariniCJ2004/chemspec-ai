Marlex® 9118 Polyethylene 
MEDIUM DENSITY POLYETHYLENE (MDPE) 
 
This medium density polyethylene is an ethylene-hexene 
copolymer tailored for injection molding applications that 
require: 
 Excellent cold temperature impact strength
 Moderate stiffness 
 Good flow 
Typical injection molding applications for 9118 include:
