Drispac® Polymers are high -quality Polyanionic cellulose polymers. They are used 
for inhibition, water -loss control and viscosity in water –based muds.  Drispac ® 
Polymer comes in two viscosity grades:  Drispac ® Regular Polymer (high viscosity) 
and Drispac® Superlo® Polymer (medium viscosity). 
Advantages 
• Control fluid loss 
• Promotes fragile gels 
• Inhibits hydrateable, swelling shales 
• Increases resistance of clay muds to contamination 
• Non-fermenting, no preservative needed 
• Good thermal stability to ≥ 300°F 
• Produces thin, slick, tough filter cake 
• Environmentally compatible 
• Retards drilled solids build-up by inhibiting cutting disintegration  
• Reduces friction and can reduce ECD 
• Works well at any salinity 
Drispac® Regular and Drispac® Superlo® Polymers 
Application Material Needed 
Fluid-loss control 0.1 to 3.0 ppb (0.3 to 9.0 kg/m3) 
Inhibition/encapsulation  0.75 to 3.0 ppb (2 to 9.0 kg/m3) 
Improved filter cake 0.5 ppb (2.0 to kg/m3) 
Improved and Stabilized Rheology 0.5 to 1.0 ppb (2.0 to 3 kg/m3) 
Reduce stuck pipe frequency 0.5 to 0.75 ppb (1.0 to 2.0 kg/m3) 
Improved hole cleaning 0.5 to 3.0 ppb (2 to 9.0 kg/m3) 
 
Cost 
 
The purity and assured high quality of the 
products are strong contributors to lower 
overall mud costs and total well costs. 
 
Mud Types:  
 
Water-based drilling and drill-in fluids, work 
over fluids and completion fluids of any 
salinity.  More efficient performance with 
calcium below 500 ppm.  Slightly more 
polymer needed at higher calcium levels.   
 
Mixing Requirements 
 
Drispac® Regular Polymer and Drispac® 
Superlo® Polymer:  Mix slowly through 
conventional jet hopper. 
 
Handling  
  
For specific instruction on handling refer to 
the MSDS. 
 
Packaging  
 
Drispac® Polymers: 50-pound, multiwall 
paper sacks
